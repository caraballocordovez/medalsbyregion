# medalsbyregion

My goal was to do a "sport portrait" of different regions of the world. Starting from the historic dataset of Olympics medalists, I wanted to compare the regions of the world visualizing the disciplines that each of them have been best at. Latin America, for example, has a long tradition of football (soccer); Africa is great at athletism; no one beats Europe in sailing; and North America is the champion in swimming. The bubble chart helps to understand how the strengths of humanity are distributed around the globe.
